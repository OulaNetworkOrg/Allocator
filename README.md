# Oula Network Allocator
Contact: oulanetworkorganization@gmail.com

## Client Scope
Any client looking to onboard a Public Dataset to Filecoin can apply to this allocator pathway.

## Client Requirements
To participate, clients must meet the following criteria:
- Dataset Storage: A minimum of 4 sealed copies of each dataset, stored with 4 distinct Storage Provider (SP) entities, located in at least 2 different regional locations to ensure geographic redundancy.
- Data Accessibility: Datasets must be readily retrievable on the network, with a minimum retrieval success rate of 75%.
- Transparency: Clients must disclose their SP partners upfront. The use of VPNs by SPs is strictly prohibited to ensure verifiable geographic distribution.
- Exclusivity: Once approved for Fil+ DataCap allocations by Oula Network, clients must collaborate exclusively with us and are prohibited from applying for DataCap with other allocators. Clients must also equitably distribute deals across Storage Providers (SPs) in multiple regions.

## Client Diligence 
We maintain a rigorous, multi-stage verification protocol to onboard only qualified clients:
- Documentation: Clients submit legal formation documents to verify their legitimacy.
- Independent Validation: All submitted information is independently verified by Oula Network’s team to confirm authenticity.
- Structured Interviews: We conduct interviews to assess client legitimacy, operational capacity, and commitment to Fil+ guidelines.
- Scoring System: Clients are evaluated using a performance scoring system to ensure compliance with exclusivity, high retrieval rates, balanced deal distribution, and prohibition of data sharing with other clients. Poor performers (scores <6/10) may face reduced allocations or suspension.
- Transparency: All onboarding materials, including formation documents, interview outcomes, signed compliance agreements, and verification logs, are published on GitHub for community and Fil+ governance review.

## Data Diligence 
Oula Network ensures program integrity through a comprehensive data diligence process, verifying that all datasets comply with Fil+ guidelines and local/regional regulations. Our process includes:

1. Dataset Size Verification:
- Process: Before approving DataCap applications, we verify that the requested dataset size matches the actual data available. Post-allocation, we cross-reference allocated DataCap against encapsulated data using Filecoin’s blockchain metadata.
- Outcome: Prevents over-allocation and ensures DataCap aligns with actual storage needs.

2. Data Downloadability and Description Consistency:
- Process: We periodically sample stored data to confirm accessibility and consistency with the client’s dataset description.
- Outcome: Ensures data integrity and accessibility, maintaining trust in the network.

3. Legal Compliance:
- Clients must provide detailed documentation of data preparation methodologies and dataset characteristics to confirm compliance with local and regional regulations. We conduct random data ownership audits, deal data validation, and Payload CID cross-verification using Filecoin tools.

4. Transparency:
- All audit documentation, including client-submitted materials, compliance agreements, mapping file samples, verification logs, and monitoring outcomes, is published on GitHub for community and governance review.

## How to Get DataCap
Client can get the DataCaps on the (https://github.com/OulaNetworkOrg/Allocator/issues/) to initialize an new issue.

## Allocation Schedule
Oula Network adheres to the standard Fil+ allocation tranche schedule, tailored for our pathway:
- First Allocation: Maximum 5% of total DataCap, capped at 256 TiB.
- Second Allocation: Maximum 10%.
- Third Allocation: Maximum 15%.
- Fourth Allocation: Maximum 20%.
- Fifth and Subsequent Allocations: Maximum 25%.
Growth Restriction: No allocation can exceed twice the size of the previous allocation.

## Performance Scoring System
To evaluate client and Storage Provider performance and guide DataCap allocation decisions, we implement a scoring system based on the following weighted criteria:
DC Received from Others: 20% (2 points) – Measures if clients receive DataCap from other allocators, ensuring exclusivity.
SP Retrieval Rate: 30% (3 points) – Tracks retrieval success rate (target ≥80%).
Deal Replication: 20% (2 points) – Ensures at least four valid replicas per dataset across distinct SPs.
Deal Shared with Others: 30% (3 points) – Verifies clients do not share deals with other allocators.

Scoring Impact on Allocations:8–10/10: Previous allocation increased by 10% (up to 25% max).
6–8/10: Previous allocation increased by 5% (up to 25% max).
4–6/10: No change to previous allocation.
0–4/10: Previous allocation reduced by 5% (minimum 5%).

## Disputes Handling
Disputes are managed transparently to ensure accountability and community trust:
- Submission: Disputes are submitted via a public Google document, accessible to all stakeholders.
- Review: Issues are assessed and prioritized within 48 hours, with status updates documented in the Google doc.
- Resolution: A senior Oula Network team member conducts an in-depth investigation for complex cases, providing a resolution within 10 days. Outcomes and rationales are published in the Google doc, anonymized for privacy.
- Escalation: Unresolved disputes are escalated to the Fil+ Governance Team for final review and decision.
- Transparency: All dispute records, including submissions, discussions, and resolutions, are publicly accessible in the Google doc and summarized on GitHub.
